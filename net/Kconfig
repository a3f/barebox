	  By default, barebox will generate random Ethernet addresses for
	  interfaces that had no explicit Ethernet address set via
	  either board code or NVMEM properties in device tree.

	  Say y here, to generate the random Ethernet address only
	  if no serial number was registered. If barebox_set_serial_number()
	  has been called, its hash will be used instead to generate
	  MAC addresses that are unlikely to change between subsequent
	  runs of barebox.
